# White House for Android mobile application

A native Android (Java) app designed to fetch, cache, and display
multiple feeds containing articles, photos, and live and on demand
video. These are displayed in a web view. Includes support for push
notifications.

This application is under active development and will continue to be
modified and improved over time.

## Goals

By releasing the source code for this app we hope to empower other
governments and organizations to build and release mobile apps to
engage their own citizens and constituencies. In addition, public
review and contribution to the application's code base will help
strengthen and improve the app.

## Requirements

1. Android 2.2 "Froyo" or higher
2. RSS feeds for content to be aggregated and displayed by the app

## Recommended

1. Android 3.1 "Honeycomb" or higher is required for live video streaming.

## Usage

Mobile developers will be able to configure the application to
retrieve and display content from arbitrary RSS feeds. The developer
will be able to configure the app to receive push
notifications. Placeholder assets may be replaced to customize the
app's look and feel.

### Building the App

The Android SDK for API level 16 is require to build the app.

The White House app uses the following libraries, which are all
included as submodules in `contrib/`:

* [ActionBarSherlock][] - action bar for older versions of Android
* [ViewPagerIndicator][] - paging indicators widgets
* [Undergarment][] - slide-out view (side nav) support library

To initialize the submodules, run:

    git submodule update --init

The following libraries are included as source:

* [Zepto.js][]
* [Underscore.js][]

### Code Style

Contributers are expected to adhere to the official [Android
Code Style Guidelines][style].


NOTE: Setting up the application and configuring it for use in your
organization's context requires Android development experience. The
application ships with a similar design to what is used in the White
House for Android mobile application. The application ships with
"white label" placeholder assets that should be replaced by the
developer.
